text: ## Hayward's Heath to Lewes and Newhaven
The line passes through an undulating, and in some places a hilly, country to [Cook's Bridge](/stations/cooks-bridge).

## Lewes to Hailsham, Eastbourne, & Hastings.
The line from Lewes turns eastward, round the foot of Mount Caburn, and after passing through a valley in the South Downs, reaches the station at [Glynde](/stations/glynde).

Immediately on leaving [Polegate](/stations/polegate), eastward, commences the Pevensey level, the scene of the Norman Conquest; and the coast from hence to [Hastings](/stations/hastings) is rich in association with this grand chapter of our civilisation.
