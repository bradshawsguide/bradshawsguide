text: At Bow the train receives and puts down passengers; and soon after starting from which we find ourselves in an open country; on the left is <span class="u-smcp">Victoria Park</span>, and a little to the right an extensive view over the Hackney marshes, terminating with a considerable portion of the well-wooded scenery of Essex. Passing onward, through the verdant fields, we come to the retired village of *Homerton*, the church and parsonage house of which are pleasing specimens of architecture.
