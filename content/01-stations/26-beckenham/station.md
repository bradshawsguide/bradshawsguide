text: The church is ancient, with some brasses and monuments worth notice. In the churchyard is a *Lich* gate, for the reception of the corpse on arrival, an erection peculiar to this county, carried down from the Saxon era.

*Langley Park* and *Kilsey Park* are near. The thriving town of Bromley, on the Ravensbourne, is 1Â½ mile distant. The Bishops of Rochester have a palace here, with some pretty grounds, where there is a chalybeate spring, called St. Blaze's well. The church has a Norman font, a monument to Dr. Hawksworth, and the tomb of Dr. Johnson's wife. Bishop Warner's College for clergymen's widows is in this town.
