text: Situated in the midst of a fine open country, which, from its elevated character, presents many beautiful views of the city and country to the south, including even Windsor Castle, in Berkshire. The air is remarkably salubrious. Soon after passing the station of [Finchley](/stations/finchley) we arrive at that of [Edgware Road](/stations/edgware-road), to the right of which Paddington Cemetery and the Victoria Rifles' Drill Ground are close at hand. [Kensal Green](/stations/kensal-green), a little to the left of the line, is next passed, and about a mile further we cross the main line of the London and North Western, and thus pass on to the lines of the [North & South Western Junction](/companies/north-and-south-western-junction).
