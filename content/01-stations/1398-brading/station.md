text: Brading, a decayed place, with an old Town Hall near the church, in which are the monuments of the Oglanders of Nunwell. In the churchyard is the grave of little Jane, the subject of one of Legh Richmond's well known stories. He was Vicar of Brading, and her cottage is pointed out under Brading Down. The harbour is like a shallow lagoon between Bembridge Point and St. Helen's old chapel. Yaverland and its curious little church, Culver Cliff, 400 ft. high, with the Yarborough pillar on the top, and Whitecliff Bay below, are to the left.
