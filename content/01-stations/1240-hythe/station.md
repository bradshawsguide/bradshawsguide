text: One of the Cinque ports, although with a ruined haven. It is small but clean and healthy, and is prettily situated at the foot of a steep hill extending to the sea. The church is very ancient, the light and elegant early English architecture mingling with Norman impart a most pleasing effect. One mile north-west is *Saltwood Castle*, once in the possession respectively of the De Montforts and the De Essex's. The ruins encircle an extensive area. The gatehouse, or keep, which was built by Archbishop Courtenay, in the reign of Richard III., is a noble pile. On the south side of the area are the ruins of the chapel, a handsome structure of peculiar architecture. Three miles to the west is the village of *Lymfine* and *Shetfall Castle*, an ancient fort of the Romans to guard the haven. Near Hythe commences *Romney Marsh*, extending along the coast for twenty miles, including an area of about 60,000 acres, which within the last few years have been successfully drained and cultivated.

The deep chalk cutting that succeeds our departure from Westenhanger introduces us to Saltwood Tunnel, and, emerging from this, we immediately catch on the right the first transient glimpse of the sea--that sight which involuntarily quickens our pulse, and sends a pleasurable emotion tingling through our veins. A lofty amphitheatre of hills, stretching away in the blue distance, varies the view in the opposite direction. Passing [Shorncliffe Camp](/stations/shorncliffe-camp), we then come to an embankment, and, borne across a viaduct 90 feet above the valley below, we come almost magically within a fine view of Folkestone and its harbour, immediately afterwards reaching the station at [Folkestone](/stations/folkestone).
