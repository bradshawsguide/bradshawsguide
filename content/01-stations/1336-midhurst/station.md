text: Midhurst, in the neighbourhood of which is West Lavington Church, a neat structure, of local stone, situated on the side of a hill, from whence a magnificent prospect may be obtained. No doubt it will long be revered as being the resting-place of the mortal remains of the late Richard Cobden, Esq. and his son. *Dunford*, the house in which the great free-trader was born, stood on the crest of a hill, in a little wooded glen, about a mile further south. It has since been rebuilt, and formed part of the gift presented to him by the country for his national services.
