text: A mile further is [Sandhurst](/stations/sandhurst) Royal Military College, situated to the right of the line, in the centre of a fine park. Peculiar interest attaches to this establishment, from the fact of its being the school where some of our ablest military men have acquired that rudimentary education which they have afterwards, turned to such good practical account in the field. The railway then takes almost a direct line for several miles to [Wokingham](/stations/wokingham).
