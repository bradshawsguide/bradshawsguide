text: This is the nearest station for Esher and Claremont; the former, once a place of some importance, is now little better than an inconsiderable village. Esher Place is remarkable as having been the residence of Wolsey, when Bishop of Winchester; and a small castled turret, near the River Mole, is exhibited as the place of his temporary imprisonment.

**Claremont,** which is adjoining, has a melancholy interest, from the death of the lamented Princess Charlotte, which took place in 1317. The palace has since belonged to her husband, the King of the Belgians, who subsequently appropriated it to the use of the exiled Orleans family, when Louis Philippe left France in 1848, and who have resided in it since his death, in comparative seclusion. From the Ditton station we cross Walton Heath, and reach the station at [Walton & Hersham](/stations/walton-and-hersham).
