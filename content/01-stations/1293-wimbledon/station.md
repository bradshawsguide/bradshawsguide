text: Wimbledon was formerly celebrated in the annals of duelling, a practice which has now become synonymous with our notions of "*such killing being murder,*" and therefore, like many other customs and habits of uncivilised beings, it has been discountenanced and condemned by that general spirit of good feeling and sense which now happily pervades all classes of the community.
