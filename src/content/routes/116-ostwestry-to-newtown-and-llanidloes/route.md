text: Running through the stations of [Llynclys](/stations/llynclys), [Pant](/stations/pant), [Llanymynech](/stations/llanymynech) (the junction of a short line, *via* [Llansaintffraid](/stations/llansaintffraid) and [Llanfechain](/stations/llanfechain), to [Llanfyllin](/stations/llanfyllin), a place celebrated for its ponies), [Four Crosses](/stations/four-crosses), [Arddleen](/stations/arddleen), [Pool Quay](/stations/pool-quay), and [Buttington](/stations/buttington), to [Welshpool](/stations/welshpool); but, should time permit, we recommend the tourist to leave the road at Oswestry, and pass by the vale of *Tanat* for its beautiful scenery, *Llangynog*, and old cell of St, Melangel, near it, to *Llanfyllin*, thence by *Guilsfield* Church (at *Garvn*, close by a Roman camp and road) to Welshpool.

[Forden](/stations/forden) and [Montgomery](/stations/montgomery). Making for the banks of the Severn, we come to the pretty little village of [Abermule](/stations/abermule), (the junction of a short, line to [Kerry](/stations/kerry)) situated at the junction of the rivers Mule and Severn, a little to the left of which is *Castell Dolforgan*, an old ruin on a hill--but surrounded by beautiful scenery. About four miles beyond is the busy little town of [Newtown](/stations/newtown).

Passing the station of [Scafell](/stations/scafell), we next come to that of [Moat Lane](/stations/moat-lane), the junction of [the Machynlleth section](/routes/newtown-to-machynlleth) of the Cambrian line.
