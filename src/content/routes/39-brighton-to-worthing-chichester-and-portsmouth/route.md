text: On leaving the terminus the line turns off abruptly towards the east, and passing through the New England tunnel, cut in the chalk cliff beneath Henfield Road, reaches the station at

(station: hove)

[cliftonville](/stations/cliftonville), [Portslade](/stations/portslade) and [Southwick](/stations/southwick) stations.

(station: kingston-on-sea)

The line proceeds along the shore, presenting no feature worth remarking, and reaches

(station: new-shoreham)

(station: lancing)

A few miles beyond this we reach the more important station and town of

(station: worthing)

The line proceeds three miles further on, and reaches the station at

(station: goring)

After which an additional four miles bring us to the station at

(station: angmering)

The line still proceeding through a fine and highly cultivated country, passes the villages of *Poleing* and *Leominster*, at the latter of which there is a curious old church, and arrives at

(station: littlehampton)

Crossing the river Arun, we then arrive at the station for [Arundel](/stations/arundel), about 1¾ mile north by rail.

(station: ford)

The line passes on a level, with the open sea on one side and the South Downs on the other, and reaches the station at

(station: barnham)

This station forms the junction of a short line to

(station: bognor)
(station: drayton)
(station: chichester)

[Bosham](/stations/bosham).--Soon after leaving this station we enter the county of Hants, and arrive at the station of

[Emsworth](/stations/emsworth), a small town at the head of the channel, which forms a part of Chichester and Langstone harbours, and which, when the tide is up, presents a very striking appearance, resembling an inland lake; but when the water is out, little is seen but an assemblage of mud banks, with here and there channels of deep water between them.

(station: havant)

The junction of the South Coast and South Western Lines is at Portcreek, between Havent and Cosham, but it is necessary to go to Portsmouth to pass from one line to the other.

(station: portsmouth)
