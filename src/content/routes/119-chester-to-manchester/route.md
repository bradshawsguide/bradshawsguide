text: *(Vi√¢ Warrington and Newton Junction).*

The station at Chester stands to the north-east of the city, with *Abbot's Grange* a little to the left. About two miles along the line we pass *Hoole Hall*, the residence of Lady Broughton, and a little beyond, the village of *Mickle Trafford*, and shortly after arrive at the first station on the line, that of [Dunham Hill](/stations/dunham-hill), close to which are *Wimbold's Trafford Hall* and *Bridge Trafford*. The next place we stop at is [Helsby](/stations/helsby). The line direct from Manchester to Liverpool turns off here, and takes a direction along the marshy shores of the Mersey to the town of [Ince](/stations/ince).

Continuing our course along the side of the river we pass [Whitby Locks](/stations/whitby-locks), at the station for which we stop for a minute. The river hence begins to recede; we pass the station of [Sutton](/stations/sutton), and in about four minutes arrive at [Hooton](/stations/hooton), the junction with the [line from Chester to Birkenhead](/routes/chester-to-birkenhead-and-liverpool).

Leaving the station at Helsby we are borne along the base of a range of hills to our right, the principal of which is that of Overton, behind which is the town of Overton, of course concealed from our view. We are now at [Frodsham](/stations/frodsham).

Next in succession is [Runcorn Road](/stations/runcord-road), three miles to the left of which is Runcorn. [Norton](/stations/norton), [Daresbury](/stations/daresbury) and [Warrington](/stations/warrington) stations.

The arrival of the train at Newton Bridge, the junction of the line with the London and North Western, is soon announced; and passing the stations of [Kenyon](/stations/kenyon_junction), [Bury Lane](/stations/bury-lane), [Astley](/stations/astley), [Patricroft](/stations/patricroft), [Eccles](/stations/eccles), and [Ordsal](/stations/ordsal), we arrive at [Manchester](/stations/manchester).
