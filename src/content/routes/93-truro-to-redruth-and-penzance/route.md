text: The first station we pass is [Chacewater](/stations/chacewater), where we cross the valley by means of a lofty wooden viaduct, [Scorrier Gate](/stations/scorrier-gate) station next succeeds, and with all the mixed desolate and wild appearances, always allied to mining districts, such as heaps of debris of abandoned mines, the remains of engine houses, and chimney shafts tottering to their fall, we arrive at [Redruth](/stations/redruth). Passing [Pool](/stations/pool), a few minutes more brings us to [Camborne](/stations/camborne). After passing [Gwinear Road](/stations/gwinear-road) we soon arrive at [Hayle](/stations/hayle).

Passing along the lower end of the Hayle estuary, we arrive at the station of [St. Ives Road](/stations/st-ives-road), near the village of St. Erth, about three miles from which is [St. Ives](/stations/st-ives).

Proceeding on our way from [Marazion Road](/stations/marazion-road), winding round the margin of this beautiful bay, we soon arrive at [Penzance](/stations/penzance).
