text: The Machynlleth section of the Cambrian line begins at [Moat Lane](/stations/moat-lane).

Leaving the station westward we soon come to the small hamlet of [Caersws](/stations/caersws), which has the remains of two Roman camps. The river Carno falls into the Severn at this point. We then leave the latter, and, taking a direction parallel with the former, come to the town of

[Carno](/stations/carno), remarkable for the bloody contentions which, in the earlier history of the principality, from time to time took place amongst its princes.

[Llanbrynmair](/stations/llanbrynmair) and [Cemmes Road](/stations/cemmes-road) are respectively passed and our arrival announced at [Machynlleth](/stations/machynlleth).
