text: This section of the line, under the name of the Metropolitan Extension, joins with that of the [Western](/routes/london-to-chatham-and-dover) at Herne Hill, and has become very much crowded with local traffic. Leaving Victoria, we almost immediately cross the Thames, pass [Battersea Park](/stations/battersea-park), and arrive at [Stewart's Lane](/stations/stewarts-lane), at which are situate extensive works belonging to the company. From thence we pass [Wandsworth Road](/stations/wandsworth-road), [Clapham](/stations/clapham), and [Brixton](/stations/brixton) to [Herne Hill](/stations/herne-hill), the point of connection with the City or eastern section of the line.
