text: This is a neat and respectable town, close to the western border of Salisbury Plain, on which, in the neighbourhood, are many remains of the old Britons. There is likewise a huge rampart and ditch called "Old Ditch" which may be attributed to the Saxons. The church is spacious and handsome. The tower is of the reign of Edward III.

Proceeding on our way with *Battlesbury*, *Middlebury*, *Scratchbury*, *Cotley*, and *Golden Barrow*, close by on our left (all ancient encampments), we arrive at [Heytesbury](/stations/heytesbury).
