text: About one mile beyond Willesden Junction we cross the Great Western, and another mile brings us to the town of Acton. Here Sir Mathew Hale, Bishop Lloyd, and Baxter lived. The old Catholic church is worth a visit.

[A short branch](/routes/acton-to-hammersmith), 1Â¼ mile, turns off to the left here, by which the tourist is enabled to visit [Hammersmith](/stations/hammersmith).
