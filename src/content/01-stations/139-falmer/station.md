text: A deep cutting commences here, which is succeeded by a tunnel, followed by another deep cutting; then a shorter one, and we obtain a sight of Lewes, St. Anne's Church and the Castle being the most prominent objects. Nothing remarkable occurs after this till we reach the foot of Water Shoot Hill, where the railway crosses the Winterbourne, and taking a course to the right by a short tunnel enters Southover, passing under the road which leads from Lewes to Newhaven. It then crosses the priory grounds, and thus arrives at the station at **Lewes**, which is in High Street, at the foot of School Hill. For description, see [Lewes](/station/lewes).
