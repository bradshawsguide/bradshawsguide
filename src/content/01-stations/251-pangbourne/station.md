text: This place is a very ancient one. Roman remains have been discovered. It is connected with *Whitchurch* on the opposite side of the Thames by a wooden bridge, toll one halfpenny.

Soon after leaving the station the railway takes a north-westerly direction, and at the village of *Basildon*, crossing a viaduct over the Thames leaves behind it the county of Berks, and enters that of Oxford. Pursuing this northerly direction for a short distance, on the borders of the two counties, we pass a deep cutting, whence, crossing on an embankment the river Thames for the last time, we reach the station of [Goring](/stations/goring).
