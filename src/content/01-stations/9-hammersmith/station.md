text: The most remarkable object here is the Suspension Bridge, a light and elegant structure, 688 feet long and 20 feet wide, completed by Tierney Clarke in 1827, at a cost of about Â£80,000. A charge of a halfpenny per passenger is made.

[Retracing our route to Acton](/routes/acton-to-hammersmith), and pursuing our course onward a mile and a half, we are brought to our destination at [Kew](/stations/kew).
