text: A short distance to the north is *Angmering Park* and *Michel Grove*. The line still proceeding through a fine and highly cultivated country, passes the villages of *Poleing* and *Leominster*, at the latter of which there is a curious old church, and arrives at [Littlehampton](/stations/littlehampton).
