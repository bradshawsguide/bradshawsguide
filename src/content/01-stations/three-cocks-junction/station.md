text: Three Cocks, at which is a good inn. This station forms the junction with the North Western section of the Brecon and Merthyr line, and affords a valuable opportunity to the tourist to visit the romantic and hitherto almost inaccessible districts of
the upper Wye. In the immediate vicinity are *Gwyrnefed*, Colonel Wood's seat, and *Maeslwch Castle*, the property of Captain De Winton. W.
Wilkins took the name of De Winton many years ago.
