text: This town, situated in Waltham Chase, was an ancient seat of the Winchester prelates, and there are traces left of their palace, in which William of Wykeham died. He was born (1324) at Wyckham or Wickham a few miles south. The Chase is now reclaimed or enclosed. In the last century it was overrun by a gang of poachers, or Waltham Blacks.
