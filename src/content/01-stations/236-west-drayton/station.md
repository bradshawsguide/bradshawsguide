text: Distance from station, Â¼ mile.

A telegraph station.

Here, in the early mornings of summer and golden evenings of autumn, descends many a brother of the rod and line, who, in the confluence of the Colne and Crane, finds a prolific source of pleasure from his favourite pastime.

We now cross the western boundary of Middlesex, and then pass over a small corner of Buckinghamshire, between West Drayton and Maidenhead, into the county of Berks.

Soon after leaving West Drayton we cross the river Colne and its branches, with *Hunt's Moor Park*, and the beautifully sequestered village of Iver (which, alike to artist or antiquary, will be found replete with objects of interest and attraction), on the right, and enter Buckinghamshire, arriving at the station at [Langley](/stations/langley).
