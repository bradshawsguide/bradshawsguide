text: Its church is a very ancient structure, erected on the hill, and contains within several noble monuments; whilst the exterior displays evidence of the havoc committed upon it during the civil wars, the spire having been destroyed by the artillery of the Parliamentary forces. Edward the Elder, one of the Saxon kings, died in a palace here in 925.

To those who duly estimate the worth of a fine prospect, we recommend a visit up the hill to Farringdon High Trees, which, in its extensive survey, includes the major portion of three counties--Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire. By sunrise or sunset, a view from this spot is amongst the finest panoramas from nature's exhaustless pencil.

Leaving the station, and progressing on an ascent of about "seven feet in a mile, we are carried on an embankment past the village of Baulking, about two miles distant from which is Kingston Lisle, with its celebrated "Blowing Stone," in which there are several apertures, and by blowing into any one of these a sound is produced that can be heard for miles distant Uffington Castle is close by, and a little further on is seen the celebrated *White Horse* which was carved by order of Alfred, in memory of the triumphant victory which, in 873, he gained over the. Danes, at Ashbury.
