text: Petersfield, a neat little town of great antiquity. It has a population of 5,655, and returns one member to parliament. Near the chapel there is an equestrian statue of William III, built by the Joliffes of Merstham.

&#8748; To the left [a line](/routes/petersfield-to-midhurst) about 9 miles long runs through [Rogate](/stations/rogate) and [Elsted](/stations/elsted) to [Midhurst](/stations/midhurst). It is intended, ultimately, to carry the line forward to [Petworth](/stations/petworth), in connection with the Brighton system. The distance, at present, is traversed by coach.
