text: The little village that gives name to the station is most pleasantly situated, but contains no object worthy of remark.

This station is the junction point with the [branch line to Salisbury](/routes/bishopstoke-to-salisbury), and also the point of union between the Gosport and Southampton trains, the line to the former diverging slightly to the left.
