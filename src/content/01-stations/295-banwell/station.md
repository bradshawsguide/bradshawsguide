text: This little village has become of some notoriety from the discovery of two caverns in its vicinity, one called the Stalactite, and the other the Bone Cave, which attract a great number of visitors. Locking and Hatton adjacent, with their antiquated churches--the cavern of Wokey, and the Chees--celebrated cliffs of Cheddar, are all worth visiting.
