text: Telegraph station at Kew, 1 mile.

The church should be visited, for here lies, surmounted by a handsome tomb, "Hogarth's honoured dust," and close by are the Horticultural Society's Gardens, a very favourite resort of England's aristocracy on its fete days. The railway then passes beneath the old Great Western coach road, and arrives at Kew station, close to the junction with the North and South Western Junction Railway. A walk across the bridge brings us to [Kew](/stations/kew).
