text: Here commences the "Vale of the White Horse," deriving its singular denomination from the gigantic carving of that useful quadruped, on a high chalky hill beyondâ€”but the cuttings that soon after succeed, "not long, but deep." effectually screen a very pretty country from the eyes of the traveller, save at occasional intervals, when an elevated embankment offers some transient glimpses.

Borne over the Wiltshire and Berks Canal, we soon after reach [Wantage Road](/stations/wantage-road) Station for Wantage.
