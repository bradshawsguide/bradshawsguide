Within a short distance, situated most beautifully in a romantic park washed by the "Sullen Mole," are the ruins of *Betchworth Castle*.

They are most picturesque, and the grey walls, contrasting with the rich green of the ivy creeping over a great part of them, stand out finely against the deep blue sky.

Proceeding on our way, with the lofty down on our right, we pass over the Mole by a viaduct 50 feet high, and then through Box Tunnel to the station at [Box Hill](/stations/box-hill).
