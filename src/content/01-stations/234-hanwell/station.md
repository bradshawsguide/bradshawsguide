A telegraph station.

From this station the line passes in a gentle curve over the Wharncliffe Viaduct, a massive and elegant structure, which commands extensive views on both sides. The Uxbridge road is seen winding beneath, and afar off may be discerned, outlined in the blue distance, the undulating range of Surrey hills, with the rich, leafy, loftiness of Richmond Hill and Park occasionally intervening. In the foreground will be noticed *Osterley Park*, the seat of the Earl of Jersey; and the most interesting object in the landscape is Hanwell Asylum, generously devoted to the reception of the indigent insane.
