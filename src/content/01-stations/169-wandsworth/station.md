text: This station, situated is within a short distance of the parish that gives it the name of Wandsworth, which with the other suburban districts we have passed through, contains a number of elegant villas, belonging to the opulent class of city merchants.

On leaving Wandsworth we have for a moment a picturesque peep at the Thames, and the line pursues a southerly direction through a deep cutting of some extent, until we reach [Putney](/stations/putney).
