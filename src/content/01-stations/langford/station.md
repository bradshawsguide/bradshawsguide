text: In this vicinity are Steeple Langford, Hanging Langford, Stapleford, Groveley Wood (here the Wiltshire hounds meet), and at East Castle, are earthworks 214 yards round. Groveley Castle contains 14 acres, is single ditched, with ramparts, and commands a beautiful view; and Hamshill, with its ditches: all of these are thought to have been British towns, occupied by the Romans. The train then proceeds on to [Wishford](/stations/wishford).
