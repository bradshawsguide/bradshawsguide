text: Chilham Home, or Manor is a noble building, situated in beautiful grounds, which command extensive views over the entire Vale of Ashford and the Stour.

Thence the windings of the Stour, spanned ever and anon by some rustic bridge of wood or stone, enhances the romantic beauty of the landscape, and we seem to be for many miles treading the sylvan labyrinth of a miniature Rhine-land.

Shortly afterwards, the towers of Canterbury Cathedral rise into sight, followed by the lofty buildings of the city itself, and whilst watching the course of the railway to Whitstable, which branches off to the north, the accustomed warning sound of the whistle rings in our ears, and we glide beneath the commodious structure of the station at [Canterbury](/stations/canterbury).
