text: We next pass over the [Great Northern Railway](/companies/great-northern), which presents one of the most singular views through which the railroad passes. From this bridge, looking down the gorge of a deep valley, we observe the lines of the Great Northern Railway gently curving to the entrance of the tunnel. In the centre of the Great Northern Railway, a short distance from the tunnel, are two immense piers upwards of 60 feet in height, which support the viaduct of the Camden Town Railway. Beyond this viaduct lie Copenhagen fields, the site of the new *Smithfield Market*. The large building with the lofty tower is the *New Prison*, erected at the expense of the Corporation of London in 1842, and will contain 1,000 prisoners. After passing several beautiful villas we reach Camden Town, where the railway is constructed upon a brick viaduct, of good proportions. The main roads are crossed by wrought-iron boiler-plate bridges upon the same principle as that of the celebrated tubular bridge over the Menai Straits. Some of these bridges are of considerable span, and the details of their construction are well worthy the close examination of those who can appreciate works of this kind. We soon enter upon ground intersected with, the rails of the [London and North Western Railway](/companies/london-and-north-western) until we reach [Camden Road](/stations/camden-road).
