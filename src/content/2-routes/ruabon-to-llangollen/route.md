text: This line leads into the very heart of the picturesque and beautiful. From [Ruabon](/stations/ruabon) the line runs *via* the stations of [Acrefair](/stations/acrefair) and [Trevor](/stations/trevor) to [Llangollen](/stations/llangollen).

The Vale of Llangollen is said to equal any of the beauties of the Rhine, and it no doubt surpasses them in works of art, the aqueduct and viaduct being splendid ornaments to this lovely work of nature.
