text: This has been called the "Pleasure Line;" and certainly the beauty and extent, of the country traversed by its trains justly entitle it to that distinguishing appellation. It is not only one of the chief mediums of daily communication between England and the Continent, but its iron roads and branches intersect the beautiful county of Kent in all directions, affording the inhabitants of the great metropolis faculties of visiting the numerous watering places on its coast, and enabling them to become acquainted with its picturesque scenery, cities, and baronial halls, and he astonishing fertility of its soil.

### London to Red Hill
No sooner is the train in motion than we escape from the confinement of the station and emerge into purer air--although the first mile we pass over no less than a dozen streets, thronged with a restless, busy population, who inhabit the dense neighbourhood of Horsleydown and Bermondsey. The Greenwich Railway diverges to the east, and to the west is the branch to the Bricklayers' Arms, built upon arches, and extending by the side of the Surrey Canal over a long tract of market-garden ground.

With a distant glimpse of the wood-crowned heights of Greenwich, and a near view of a large red brick building--the Royal Naval school--we arrive at the great locomotive station of the Brighton and Dover Companies; the Nunhead Cemetery, about a mile to the right. A range of undulating eminences beyond Peckham and Dulwich rapidly pass in view, and a few miles further on, almost before the eye can take in the range of picturesque suburban scenery, we reach [New Cross](/stations/new-cross).

From New Cross the train diverges from the North Kent line, and proceeds through a deep cutting that conceals all view of the country, to the Dartmouth Arms Station at Forest Hill, an exceedingly pretty spot, which is becoming a favourite residence of an increasing number of families from the metropolis. A mile beyond this is the Sydeuham Station, *in the midst of very lovely scenery*, and in view of the fairy-like scene of the *Crystal Palace*, with its marvellous transepts, and wings, and galleries, situated in the most exquisite and park-like grounds--ornamented with a noble terrace, commanding one of the finest views in England, and embellished with waterfalls, cascades, and splendid fountains--all on such a vast and magnificent scale as to suggest the idea of its being the Palace of the Celestial Empire of China, rather than that, of the people of England--by whom it ought to be liberally supported. For further description of the [Crystal Palace](/stations/crystal-palace), see [London and Brighton](london-bridge-to-brighton) route. At a short distance beyond Sydenham the line leaves the border of Kent and diverges more into the county of Surrey. The [Anerley](/stations/anerley) Station, although in a pretty situation, deserves no particular mention, in comparison with the celebrated one of [Norwood](/stations/norwood-upper). A short distance beyond Caterham Junction the railway enters the celebrated Merstham Tunnel, which is said to have cost £112,000.

Emerging thence the train reaches the village of [Merstham](/stations/merstham).

### Red Hill to Tunbridge
On leaving Reigate, the railway turns off towards the south-east, past the village of Nutfield, a short distance beyond which is Bletchingly, both situated on a range of hills. Bletchingley church is a handsome building containing several line monuments and there are the remains of a castle in the neighbourhood.

A little further on, the line passes through Bletchingley Tunnel, and shortly after the train reaches [Godstone](/stations/godstone).

### Tunbridge to Paddock Wood
On leaving Tunbridge, the line passes through the beautiful park of *Summerhill* the property of Baron de Goldschmidt, and thence, on past the villages of Tudely and Capel to the [Paddock Wood Junction](/stations/paddock-wood-junction).

### Paddock Wood to Ashford
From Paddock the main line proceeds rapidly in the direction of the coast, and although the country presents very charming alternations of waste and woodland scenery, yet it does not offer objects of sufficient interest to describe in detail. Views of hop fields are shut in by excavations which, like the change of slides in dissolving views, transform, the landscape every moment.

### Ashford to Folkestone and Dover
The main line on leaving Ashford makes a gradual approach towards the coast, swerving slightly to the south-east, and having on each side a delightful champaign country.

At [Smeeth](/stations/smeeth) the line passes almost immediately to the north of the extensive level of Romney Marsh, which may occasionally be seen from the carriages.

The deep chalk cutting that succeeds our departure from [Westenhanger](/stations/westenhanger) introduces us to Saltwood Tunnel, and, emerging from this, we immediately catch on the right the first transient glimpse of the sea--that sight which involuntarily quickens our pulse, and sends a pleasurable emotion tingling through our veins. A lofty amphitheatre of hills, stretching away in the blue distance, varies the view in the opposite direction. Passing [Shorncliffe Camp](/stations/shorncliffe-camp), we then come to an embankment, and, borne across a viaduct 90 feet above the valley below, we come almost magically within a fine view of Folkestone and its harbour, immediately afterwards reaching the station at [Folkestone](/stations/folkestone).
