text: ### Wandsworth to Barnes
The Richmond line properly branches off about the point where the road to the village of Battersea leaves the Wandsworth road, and at a short distance from Battersea. It then pursues a pretty course through the villas, orchards, and nursery gardens which stud that locality, till it reaches Wandsworth. The river Wandle and the valley are crossed by a splendid viaduct.

### Barnes to Windsor
A great portion of the line is but a few feet above the natural surface of the country, and many of the roads are crossed on a level. The country through which it passes does not present many picturesque views, the property almost throughout being circumscribed by orchards and market gardens. The want, however, of the beautiful along the line is amply compensated by the lovely views in the neighbourhood of Richmond; and from Richmond to Datchet there is a succession of splendid scenery.

### Staines to Wokingham and Reading
On leaving [Staines](/stations/staines), we soon arrive at [Egham](/stations/egham).
