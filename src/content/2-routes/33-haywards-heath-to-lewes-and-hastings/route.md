text: ### Hayward's Heath to Lewes and Newhaven

The line passes through an undulating, and in some places a hilly, country to

[Cook's Bridge](/stations/cooks-bridge), in the vicinity of which is *Coneyburrow Park*. We have here a full view of the lofty range of the south downs, the highest point of which, *Ditching Beacon*, a little to the right, is 858 feet above the sea.

(station: lewes)

(station: newhaven)

### Lewes to Hailsham, Eastbourne, & Hastings.
The line from Lewes turns eastward, round the foot of Mount Caburn, and after passing through a valley in the South Downs, reaches the station at [Glynde](/stations/glynde).

The line then passes the villages of Selmeston and Alceston to the station at

(station: berwick)

Four miles beyond, the line reaches the station at

(station: polegate)

Short lines branch off here in opposite directions to [Hailsham](/routes/polegate-to-hailsham) and [Eastbourne](/routes/polegate-to-eastbourne).

Immediately on leaving Polegate, eastward, commences the Pevensey level, the scene of the Norman Conquest; and the coast from hence to Hastings is rich in association with this grand chapter of our civilisation.

(station: pevensey)

Proceeding eastward we pass along the coast on the very beach as it were, the view relieved only by the Martello towers, which here line the shore. A short distance to the left of the line is the retired village of *Hove* and its interesting church.
