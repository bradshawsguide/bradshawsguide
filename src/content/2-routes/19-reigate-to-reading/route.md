text: This line connects the county towns of Berkshire and Surrey (Reading and Guildford), and extends from the latter across the garden of Surrey to Reigate; at the same time communicating with four trunk lines--the Great Western, the South Western, the Brighton, and the South Eastern Railway. To the pleasure tourist we scarcely know any presenting so many picturesque attractions. Its route lies from Reading along the South Eastern line, across Berkshire, by Wokingham and Sandhurst, entering Surrey by Tinley; then crossing the South Western line, onward with a branch to Farnham; at the base of Hog's Back to Guildford; next by a branch to Godalming, and continuing at the foot of the celebrated range of chalk hills past Dorking and Reigate to Red Hill.

We have alluded to the picturesqueness of the Surrey portion, which will be new ground to many a tourist; though it is perhaps, the most beautiful scenery of its class in England. Its landscapes present a rich succession of "morceaux" for the painter in its picturesque uplands, woodland, dells verdant vallies, rocky hills and undulating parks and heaths, all lying within the eye of the traveller along this line. Betchworth Park is among the most beautiful specimens of this scenery between Reigate and Dorking, although the part of the chalk hills seen from that point is greatly exceeded by the bolder sublimity of Box Hill, the venerable giant of the chain, with its luxuriant clothing of patronymic evergreen.

As a pleasure line, this portion is very popular, passing as it does through an exceedingly fine country, with the scenery of which excursion trains have already made thousands of visitors familiar.
