text: This line is only twelve miles long, but it is intended subsequently to extend it in connection with the Central Wales and Llanelly Railways to South Wales Line, thereby bringing Milford Haven, and the South Wales Districts in direct communication with the more important manufacturing districts of the North West. The line runs *via* [Broom](/stations/broom) and [Hopton Heath](/stations/hopton-heath) to [Bucknell](/stations/bucknell) and [Knighton](/stations/knighton).
