text: ### London to Croydon
The London terminus of the Brighton Railway, though approached by the same line as the South Eastern Railway, is a distinct building, occupying a considerable place to the south, at the right hand or furthest corner of the fabric, and embraces in its arrangements every thing calculated to promote the convenience of the passengers, and all that can contribute to their security. This company conveys the traffic of the counties of Surrey and Sussex, and also that with France, *via* Newhaven and Dieppe; also the passengers of the Sydenham Railway to and from the Crystal Palace.

So entangled is the mighty maze of London with its suburbs that on emerging from the station it is some time before we entirely lose sight of its multi-farious characteristics; we seem, Asmodeus-like, to be fleeting over the habitations of a dense and crowded district. The first part of the line to New Cross is carried over arches, and continues so for some time, passing by a viaduct over market gardens, as far as the Greenwich Junction, and then turns oft towards New Cross, where the Company has a large depot for repairing locomotives. Immediately the line emerges from the streets and houses that obstruct the view, and the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, sparkling in the distance, appears in sight.

### Croydon to Three Bridges
After leaving [Croydon](/stations/croydon) we pass through a short cutting, and emerge upon an embankment upwards of two miles long, which affords delightful views of the surrounding scenery; and at the distance of about 4½ miles from Croydon, arrive at the station of [Caterham Junction](/stations/caterham-junction). Proceeding on our way to the south the train passes close to the village of

**Chipstead.** the church of which, dedicated, to St. Margaret, is of Norman style, and of considerable antiquity. Sir Edward Banks, the well-known contractor and builder of the London, Southward, and Waterloo Bridges, is buried in this quiet and rural churchyard, near the scenes of his early career, where he commenced life in the neighbourhood as a labourer.

Proceeding on, some high grounds now intercept our view, until the line enters the Merstham tunnel, rather more than a mile long, and in some parts nearly 190 feet below the surface. The transition, from the gloomy darkness of the tunnel to the daylight we had temporarily forsaken is certainly agreeable, and we are rewarded on emerging by a pretty view of the little village of Merstham, and the adjacent country.

After passing [Merstham](/stations/merstham) station, which is a minor one, we obtain a fine view of *Gatton* and its picturesque park, the property of the Dowager Countess of Warwick, and famous before the Reform Bill as having returned two members to parliament, with a population of a hundred persons, living in scarcely two dozen houses. Half a mile further on, an embankment 20 feet high brings us to [Red Hill](/stations/red-hill).

### Three Bridges to Hayward's Heath.
The line now passes over an embankment of considerable length, and the railway thence commences a descent. Passing through a series of cuttings, we enter the Balcombe tunnel, the second of the great tunnels along the line, soon after emerging from which we arrive at the [Balcombe](/stations/balcombe) station.

The line proceeds southward, and enters the Weald of Sussex through Tilgate Forest, and to the Balcombe tunnel.

### Hayward's Heath to Brighton.
Retracing our way to Hayward's Heath we pass through a short tunnel, and then perceive a beautiful pastoral country, on which is dotted pretty seats of the gentry, and the farms of substantial yeomen, occasionally enlivened by a church steeple peering above its wooded covert. A short four miles and we arrive at [Burgess Hill](/stations/burgess-hill).
