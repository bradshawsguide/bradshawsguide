text: Pursuing our course along the valley of the Dee, we pass the stations of [Berwyn](/stations/berwyn) and [Glyndyfrdwy](/stations/glyndyfrdwy) to [Carrog](/stations/carrog), in the neighbourhood of which is *Llantysilio Hall*, the seat of A. Reid, Esq., near the canal resorvoir, and *Glyndwr's Mount*, marking the site of Sycarth, or Sychuant, the seat of the famous Owen Glyndwr, or Glendower, to whom the county belonged.

[Corwen](/stations/corwen).--Here the line unites with the Vale of Clwyd, through Ruthin and Denbigh, to [Rhyl](/stations/rhyl), and will ultimately proceed to Bala, Dolgelley, and Barmouth westward. At this place, the great Holyhead road strikes off through the mountains to Capel Curig (19 miles), Snowdon, and Bangor; while another follows the Dee to Bala Lake (10 miles), which has its source in the Arran Mowddwy mountains. These range 2,950 feet high at the most, and fall as a continuation of the Berwyn mountains, which appear nearer Llangollen, and at Moel Ferna (*Moel* means *bald*), within a few miles of it, are 2,100 feet high, and at Cader Berwyn, about 2,560 feet high. Under this last point (12 miles south-west) is the famous *waterfall* of *Pistyll Rhaiadyr*. Here in a dark well-wooded hollow one of the head springs of the Tanat runs down 140 feet at once, thence through a rock, and down another fall of 70 feet. There are several paths to it over the hills. It gives name to Llanrhaiadyr church, in the valley below.
