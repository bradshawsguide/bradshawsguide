text: To the tourist, this line of railway holds out peculiar attractions. The Vale of Gresford, the grounds of Wynnstay, the valley of the Dee, and the vale of Llangollen, offer some of the most beautiful views, unsurpassed for grandeur and picturesque effect. Here Cambria discloses herself between the mountains of Trevor and Berwyn, and by her own sacred Dee, the happy valley, which leads to scenes of the richest beauty, where amidst her mountains and lakes she revels in all her native splendour of rocks, woods, and streams. Throughout the rest of the line, as it crosses the valley of the Ceiriog, and passes along the borders of Wales to St. Oswald's town of Shrewsbury, the scenery is most lovely and park-like; and the adjoining Welsh mountains form, a noble and varied background to many a delightful view. It is both a business and pleasure line. It curves so as to either nearly touch or pass through the borders of Wales; it intersects a very important iron and coal district in Denbighshire, and passes either close to, or as near as possible the chief towns on its route--Oswestry, Llangollen, and Wrexham.

Proceeding on our way, with the "fair Sabrina" on our left hand, we pass *Berwick Park*, the seat of Lord Berwick, and arrive at [Leaton](/stations/leaton).

Shortly after leaving this station we pass the village of Walford, and the seat of the late R. A. Slaney, Esq. M.P. for Shrewsbury.

From [Baschurch](/stations/baschurch), Wo now traverse a swampy, flat, and uninteresting part of the country, viz., Bagley Moors, and Whyke Moss, and then crosses the river Perry.

On the left are seen a long range of high mountains called the Welsh or Breedden hills, about five miles distant; on the summit of one of them is a pillar erected in honour of Rodney's victory over the French; and *Tedsmore Hall*, the fine seat of T. Owen, Esq.

The next place we arrive at is [Rednal](/stations/rednal). Thence passing the elegant mansion in a picturesque park of *Woodhouse*, W. M. Owen, Esq. and soon after *Aston Park*, we arrive at [Whittington](/stations/whittington-low-level).

Two miles further we arrive at [Gobowen Junction](/stations/gobowen-junction).

### Oswestry Branch
The line to [Oswestry](/stations/oswestry-gwr) presents few objects worthy of notice or description. *Park Hall*, the property of R. H. Kinchant, Esq., is a singular and interesting mansion, built in the Tudor style. *Porkington*, the seat of W. Ormsby Gore, Esq., is beautifully situated, and commands some of the finest and most extensive views in the country. Farther on to the right is "Old Oswestry," an ancient military post, situated on an eminence, a very picturesque looking object from the railway.
