text: To the tourist, this line of railway holds out peculiar attractions. The Vale of Gresford, the grounds of Wynnstay, the valley of the Dee, and the vale of Llangollen, offer some of the most beautiful views, unsurpassed for grandeur and picturesque effect. Here Cambria discloses herself between the mountains of Trevor and Berwyn, and by her own sacred Dee, the happy valley, which leads to scenes of the richest beauty, where amidst her mountains and lakes she revels in all her native splendour of rocks, woods, and streams. Throughout the rest of the line, as it crosses the valley of the Ceiriog, and passes along the borders of Wales to St. Oswald's town of Shrewsbury, the scenery is most lovely and park-like; and the adjoining Welsh mountains form, a noble and varied background to many a delightful view. It is both a business and pleasure line. It curves so as to either nearly touch or pass through the borders of Wales; it intersects a very important iron and coal district in Denbighshire, and passes either close to, or as near as possible the chief towns on its route--Oswestry, Llangollen, and Wrexham.

Proceeding on our way, with the "fair Sabrina" on our left hand, we pass *Berwick Park*, the seat of Lord Berwick, and arrive at [Leaton](/stations/leaton).

Shortly after leaving this station we pass the village of Walford, and the seat of the late R. A. Slaney, Esq. M.P. for Shrewsbury.

From [Baschurch](/stations/baschurch), Wo now traverse a swampy, flat, and uninteresting part of the country, viz., Bagley Moors, and Whyke Moss, and then crosses the river Perry.

On the left are seen a long range of high mountains called the Welsh or Breedden hills, about five miles distant; on the summit of one of them is a pillar erected in honour of Rodney's victory over the French; and *Tedsmore Hall*, the fine seat of T. Owen, Esq.

The next place we arrive at is [Rednal](/stations/rednal). Thence passing the elegant mansion in a picturesque park of *Woodhouse*, W. M. Owen, Esq. and soon after *Aston Park*, we arrive at [Whittington](/stations/whittington-low-level).

Two miles further we arrive at [Gobowen Junction](/stations/gobowen-junction).

### Oswestry Branch
The line to [Oswestry](/stations/oswestry-gwr) presents few objects worthy of notice or description. *Park Hall*, the property of R. H. Kinchant, Esq., is a singular and interesting mansion, built in the Tudor style. *Porkington*, the seat of W. Ormsby Gore, Esq., is beautifully situated, and commands some of the finest and most extensive views in the country. Farther on to the right is "Old Oswestry," an ancient military post, situated on an eminence, a very picturesque looking object from the railway.

### ?
Proceeding onwards from Gobowen, with *St. Martin's* one mile on the right, and *Selattyn* one mile to the left, we soon come to the Chirk Viaduct, which carries us across the lovely vale of Ceiriog, and into the Welsh county of Denbigh, and stop at [Chirk](/stations/chirk).

Proceeding onwards, with the Chester and Ellesmere canal running for some distance parallel with us, we pass [Cefn](/stations/cefn-mawr), with *Wynnstay* and its pretty park on our right, and the works of the British Iron Company on our left, and arrive at the station of [Ruabon](/station/ruabon).

The railway from Ruabon runs parallel with Watt's and Offa's Dykes for a long distance. The mountainous district to the left is a valuable raining country, extremely prolific in coal and iron, and shortly before reaching Wrexham the traveller will perceive *Erddig Hall*, the seat of Simon York, Esq., delightfully situated on a hill, with a beautiful little river flowing at its foot The view of this mansion from the railway is exceedingly picturesque. [Wrexham](/stations/wrexham).

The train now traverses for a considerable distance what is called "free" or neutral ground where at one time trade and commerce could only be transacted between the ancient Britons; the Danes, and afterwards the Saxons.

Recrossing Watt's Dyke, we arrive at the junction of the

### Brymbo, Minera, &c, Branch.
Telegraph station at Wheatsheaf.

This mineral branch diverges to the right, and passes across the coal field to the lime rocks of Minera. It is 6Â¼ miles in length. There are several smaller branches made for the accommodation of the works at Frood, Brynmally, Westminster, South Sea, Brymbo, and Vron, to the extent of about six miles in addition.

At a place called Wheatsheaf the locomotive portion of the branch terminates, and the lower self-acting inclined plane commences, by which the loaded wagons descend, and draw up the empty ones to Summerhill level.

At Summerhill the branch pierces through the crest of a hill by a tunnel, and enters the Moss Valley, which is here a narrow ravine, beautifully wooded, having its sides studded with cottages and gardens, which are chiefly small freeholds, the property of the workmen.

From Moss Valley the main branch rises by a steep inclined plane to Peutre, at an inclination of 1 in 4. At the top it pierces through the summit of the Peutre by a tunnel, on emerging from which is Brymbo Valley and iron works From the tunnel the railway winds its course for about four miles to Minera, celebrated for its lead mines and limestone rocks. As the railway winds along the slope of the hills a most magnificent panoramic tow is obtained, extending from the Mersey, dotted with white sails, across the Vale Royal, over Cheshire and Shropshire to the Severn, flanked on the left by the Hope Mountains, and on the right by the Berwyn range, to which succeed the Brydden, the Wrekin, Caer Caradoc, and the distant Cheshire hills; and while the eye is charmed with the beauty of the landscape, the mineral treasures and the varied mechanical contrivances by which their value is brought out, commands the attention and admiration of the geologist and scientific visitor.

### ?
Passing a fine ancient mansion, called *Geversyllt Hall*, the property of Sir Watkin W. Wynne, Bart., and then, by some deep cuttings and long embankments, we reach [Gresford](/stations/gresford).

Soon after passing [Rossett](/stations/rossett) the line proceeds over a flat, fertile country called the Lache Hayes, to the left of which, as far as the eye can see,'is the long range of Clwydian Hills, the centre one being distinguished by the name of Moel Fammau, or the mother of hills. There is a monument on the summit of this mountain, erected to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the reign of George III. The view from this elevation is very extensive. The hills nearest the line are those of Hope Mountains, containing minerals of every description in profusion. The iron and coal works are seen burning at night for a considerable distance. We likewise perceive the village of *Doddleston* on the left. The church contains a monument to the memory of Chancellor Egerton, Lord Ellesmere. The next station is [Saltney](/stations/saltney).

Leaving Saltney, we soon after cross the river Dee by the largest cast-iron girder bridge in the kingdom, and a viaduct of 47 arches; then, passing through the west angle of the city walls, over the Ellesmere and Chester Canal, and through the tunnel beneath Northgate, we arrive at the Station at [Chester](/stations/chester).
