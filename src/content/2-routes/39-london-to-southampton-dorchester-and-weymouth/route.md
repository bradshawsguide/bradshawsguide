text: The main branches of this railway communicate with the suburbs of London, and are mostly celebrated for their picturesque beauty, viz.:-- Richmond, Windsor, Kew, and the valley of the Thames, Hampton Court, Kingston, Claremont, Guildford, &c.; also with Portsmouth, Winchester, Southampton, Salisbury, Isle of Wight, and Weymouth, *via* Dorchester.

Of all the many alluring rambles held forth to the tourist who wishes to avail himself of the speedy communication by rail with some of the most picturesque scenery in England, there is no line that possesses more intrinsic advantages, or which intersects in its various routes so many places of glorious memory as the South Western, from the metropolis to the south-western coast of Hampshire and Devonshire,

The [Metropolitan terminus](/stations/waterloo-bridge) of the [South Western](/companies/london-and-south-western) is at Waterloo Road. Omnibuses convey passengers to and from all parts of town. The terminus is a spacious building, admirably adapted for the different railway offices and the various departments connected with the Company. The gentle pace at which the trains first move afford time for observing the extensive engine houses and workshops at Nine Elms. The line passes over viaducts or arches through a part of the densely populated parish of Lambeth, over the tops of houses, past the grounds of Lambeth Palace, in a line with which is Lambeth Church, and across the river may be seen the splendid towers of the new Houses of Parliament.

### London to Clapham
Thence we pass on through

(station: vauxhall)

We next find ourselves bounded on each side by spacious market gardens, and we see Battersea new town and the park on the one hand, and Battersea Rise, the region of Clapham, on the other. In Battersea church the great statesman, Bolingbroke, lies buried. At this point, the [Richmond, Staines, and Windsor line](/routes/london-to-richmond-and-staines) diverges to the right, while the main line turns oft towards the left to Wimbledon.

### Clapham to Kingston
Soon after rejoining the Main Line at Clapham Common, [a branch to the left](/routes/victoria-to-crystal-palace) leads to the Crystal Palace, *via* [Balham](/stations/balham), [Streatham](/stations/streatham), and [Norwood](/stations/norwood-lower).

(station: clapham)

The adjacent country now begins to assume a very pleasant and diversified appearance, and the patches of woodland scenery that break forth in bold relief against the distant horizon furnish an agreeable foretaste of the picturesque views yet to come. Passing beneath a few arches which connect the roads leading from various adjacent villages, we reach the station at

(station: wimbledon)

[Merton](/stations/merton).--Distance from the Wimbledon station, ¾ mile. Telegraph station at Wimbledon, ¾ mile. Hotel--White Hart. The pretty village of Merton, where Lord Nelson lived, is a favourite resort of excursionists.

(route: wimbledon-to-epsom-and-leatherhead)

Emerging from the excavation, we proceed onwards over an embankment, which affords one continued series of delightful views across a country which art has contributed in the highest degree to adorn, at the extremity of which a cursory glimpse of the old square tower of Kingston church is obtained.

### Weybridge to Woking
From the hill before [Weybridge](/stations/weybridge) to [Woking](/stations/woking), a distance of six miles, there is a gradual descent After crossing the bridge which spans the Basingstoke Canal, here intersected by the canal from Guildford, and passing several villages, we pass over the Woking embankment, whence a succession of picturesque views will delight the traveller. Ottershaw Park affords a pleasing specimen of English forest scenery. The fine effect of these majestic trees, with nothing behind them but the sunny splendour of a summer morning, or the rich glow of an evening sky, realises all that Claude has embodied in his pictures.

Three-quarters of a mile beyond [Woking](/stations/woking) a line branches off to the left to Guildford and Godalming, [direct to Portsmouth](/routes/woking-to-godalming-and-portsmouth), from which [another branch](/routes/guildford-to-farnham-and-alton) diverges at Guildford and extends to Ash, Farnham, and Alton.

### Woking to Basingstoke
From Woking the line shortly crosses the road by a viaduct of one arch, and then enters the Goldworthy Hill excavation, on emerging from which it proceeds over the Frimley embankment, about four miles in length, whence an almost unbounded view of the surrounding country bursts upon the sight.

The eye ranges over one vast landscape of hills and valleys thickly wooded, and presenting a *coup d'oeil* of surpassing beauty, above which may be seen the Surrey hills stretching away for miles, and bounding one of nature's panoramas which defy description. Crossing a small streamlet, called Blackwater Brook, we leave the county of Surrey for Hampshire, and passing beneath a road, we reach [Farnborough](/stations/farnborough) Station.

### Basingstoke to Bishopstoke
The line now passes through a country bearing the true Hampshire characteristics of forest scenery, until we reach [Winchester](/stations/winchester).

### Bishopstoke to Southampton
The line traverses a country skirted in each direction by thick woody undulations. On passing [Portswood](/stations/portswood), near to which are the remains of St. Dennis's Priory, and approaching the town, however, the scenery becomes somewhat less interesting.

### Southampton to Dorchester and Weymouth.
This line of railway passes through a country of picturesque character and antiquarian interest. It branches off from the South Western Railway at the upper end of the town of Southampton, and passes through a tunnel under the old road to London. The tunnel is nearly 531 yards in length, and is cut through a soil of gravel and clay. The railway then passes on *viâ* the stations of [Redbridge](/stations/redbridge), [Totton](/stations/totton) (for Eling), and [Lyndhurst Road](/stations/lyndhurst-road), (none of which require special notice), to [Brockenhurst](/stations/brockenhurst).

[Ringwood](/stations/ringwood) forms the junction of a short line, about seven miles in length. It passes the station of [Herne](/stations/herne), near wich is *Heron Court*, the seat of the Earl of Malmesbury. It is the Elizabethan style of architecture, and has some choice pictures.
