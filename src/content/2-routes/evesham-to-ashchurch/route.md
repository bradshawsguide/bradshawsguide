text: A branch, belonging to the Midland Company, [interrupts our course](/routes/oxford-to-worchester-and-wolverhampton) at [Evesham](/stations/evesham). Crossing the river Avon, we pass, in a south-westerly direction, the stations of [Bengeworth](/stations/bengeworth), [Hinton](/stations/hinton), [Ashton-under Hill](/stations/ashton-under-hill), and [Beckford](/stations/beckford) to [Ashchurch](/stations/ashchurch), a station on the Bristol and Birmingham line. Within a distance of about 10 miles between Hinton and Ashchurch, the line crosses two arms of the rather serrated southern boundary of Worcestershire.
