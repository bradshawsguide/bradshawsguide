text: Three-quarters of a mile beyond [Woking](/stations/woking) a line branches off to the left to Guildford and Godalming, direct to Portsmouth, from which another branch diverges at Guildford and extends to Ash, Farnham, and Alton.

This route is a continuation of the line via [Guildford](/stations/guildford) and [Godalming](/stations/godalming) to [Portsmouth](/stations/portsmouth), bringing the latter place about 21 miles nearer London than by the old route, via Bishopstoke.
