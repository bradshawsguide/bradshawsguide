text: ## Hayward's Heath to Lewes and Newhaven.
The line passes through an undulating, and in some places a hilly, country to [Cook's Bridge](/stations/cooks-bridge), in the vicinity of which is *Coneyburrow Park*. We have here a full view of the lofty range of the south downs, the highest point of which, *Ditching Beacon*, a little to the right, is 858 feet above the sea.

## Lewes to Hailsham, Eastbourne, & Hastings.
The line from Lewes turns eastward, round the foot of Mount Caburn, and after passing through a valley in the South Downs, reaches the station at [Glynde](/stations/glynde).

The line then passes the villages of Selmeston and Alceston to the station at [Berwick](/stations/berwick). Four miles beyond, the line reach the station at [Polegate](/stations/polegate).

Immediately on leaving Polegate, eastward, commences the Pevensey level, the scene of the Norman Conquest; and the coast from hence to [Hastings](/stations/hastings) is rich in association with this grand chapter of our civilisation.
