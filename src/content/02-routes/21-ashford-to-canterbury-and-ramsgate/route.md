text: ### Ashford to Canterbury
At [Ashford](/stations/ashford), the line branches off to Canterbury, Whitstable, Sandwich, Deal, Ramsgate, and Margate, and, from the accommodation it affords to the towns through which it passes, and the exquisite beauty of the scenery along its route, will not suffer in comparison with any line of similar length in the kingdom. It follows throughout the meanderings of the river Stour, and traversing the most fertile district in the country, has one uninterrupted panorama of luxuriant fertility during its whole length.

On leaving Ashford, the little villages of Brook and Wye are passed in succession to the right, imbedded in a valley sheltered by rising hills, and thickly studded with lofty and umbrageous patches of woodland.

### Canterbury to Deal, Ramsgate and Margate
Quitting the Canterbury station, the line proceeds through a similar fertile tract that which accompanied its progress thither. Cattle gluing knee-deep in luxuriant pastures, farm-houses, cottages, and orchards on one side, and sunny fields, rich in corn and clover, sloping down on the other; these are the chief characteristics of the route for the next eleven miles.

At Minster Junction Station, [a branch line](/routes/minster-junction-to-deal) diverges to the ancient towns of Sandwich, and Deal, and the other, the main line, proceeds to Ramsgate and Margate, a line on a tolerably steep incline.

Kent and the Kentish coast have long been celebrated for their delicious climate and exquisite pastoral scenery, and the railway passes through a fine panorama of marine and picturesque views, until it reaches [Ramsgate](/stations/ramsgate).
