text: This line commences by a junction with the [Blackwall](/companies/london-and-blackwall) at Stepney, and also with the Eastern Counties at Ilford. Passengers may book at either Bishopsgate or Fenchurch Street; but the latter affords greater facilities as to the number of departures. A few minutes only are occupied in passing the stations of [Bromley](/stations/bromley), [Plaistow](/stations/plaistow), and [East Ham](/stations/east-ham), before arriving at the town of [Barking](/stations/barking).
