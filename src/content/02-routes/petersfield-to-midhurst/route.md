text: At [Petersfield](/stations/petersfield) a line to the left about 9 miles long runs though [Rogate](/stations/rogate) and [Elstead](/stations/elstead) to

[Midhurst](/stations/midhurst), in the neighbourhood of which is *West Lavington Church*, a neat structure, of local stone, situated on the side of a hill, from whence a magnificent prospect may be obtained. No doubt it will long be revered as being the resting-place of the mortal remains of the late Richard Cobden, Esq. and his son. *Dunford*, the house in which the great free-trader was born, stood on the crest of a hill, in a little wooded glen, about a mile further south. It has since been rebuilt, and formed part of the gift presented to him by the country for his national services.

It is intended, ultimately, to carry the line forward to [Petworth](/stations/petworth), in connection with the Brighton system. The distance, at present, is traversed by coach.
