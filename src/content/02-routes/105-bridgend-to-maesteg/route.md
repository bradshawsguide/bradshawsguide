text: The *Llynvi Valley* line, originally an old tramway, turns off here to the right, passing along the valley, rich in coal and iron, to the junction at [Tondu](/stations/tondu). From Tondu the line proceeds through a hilly country to [Llangonoyd](/stations/llangonoyd), and thence to [Maesteg](/stations/maesteg), a place of rising importance on account of its extensive iron works.
