text: ## Chippenham to Westbury
From Trowbridge we continue by the Valley of the Avon, with the grounds of *Rowed Ashton* and *Heywood House* on the left, and arrive at [Westbury](/stations/westbury).

## Westbury to Dorchester and Weymouth
Crossing the borders of the county from Westbury we soon arive at [Frome](/stations/frome).

From Yeovil a branch line to the right, of nearly 20 miles in length, joins the [Bristol and Exeter](/routes/bristol-to-exeter) line. We proceed southward, and passing the ancient village of *Bradford Abbas* and the stations of [Yetminster](/stations/yetminster) and [Evershot](/stations/evershot) (near which are *Woolcombe House* and *Melbury House* at Redlynch, the seat of the Earl of Ilchester, from the grounds of which a view may be had of an immeasurable tract of country), we arrive at [Maiden Newton](/stations/maiden-newton), from which a branch to the right takes us to Bridport.

Leaving Maiden Newton and passing along the Valley of the Frome, by the station of [Grimstone](/stations/grimstone), we arrive at [Dorchester](/stations/dorchester) and [Weymouth](/stations/weymouth).
