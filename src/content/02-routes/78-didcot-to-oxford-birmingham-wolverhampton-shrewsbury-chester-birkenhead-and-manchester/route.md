text: After passing a small and uninteresting village called Appleford, we come to a lofty embankment, from which some expansive and diversified views of the surrounding country are obtained. One mile further is the station of [Culham](/stations/culham).

About three miles beyond Culham, we come in sight of Bagley Wood, seen to the left of the line, and soon after the little church of Sandford is observed peering through the trees to the right, and the Asylum at Littlemore. A brief view of hills, a rapid glimpse of vallies, reined with pleasant streams, and studded with picturesque masses of woodland, a prolonged whistle from the engine, and a sudden whirl under a lofty, elegant portico, and we are at [Oxford](/stations/oxford).
