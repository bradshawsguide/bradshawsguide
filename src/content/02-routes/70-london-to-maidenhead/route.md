text: ## London to Slough

The *Metropolitan Terminus* of the Great Western Railway is situated on the western side of the Paddington Canal, in a line with Praed-street, Paddington, at the north-west extremity of London, and at a short distance from the northern avenues to Hyde Park, thus affording an easy access to and from all parts of town. Omnibuses leave the City one hour before the departure of each train, and call at all the booking-offices on their way, winch, in addition to the cabs, leave the passenger at no loss for a prompt conveyance to this Terminus--one of the largest and most commodious stations in London. Its external appearance is not very remarkable,--but the booking-offices are convenient, the waiting rooms comfortable, the platforms, for the arrival and departure trains, spacious enough to accommodate the largest number of excursionists ever accumulated,--and the vast area embraced by the immense roofs by which the station is covered, impart to the mind of the traveller the impression that he is about to start by the railway of a first-rate company.

It is the joint work of Messrs. Brunei and M. D. Wyatt, the former having arranged the general plan, engineering, and business portion; the latter the architectural details in every department. The principle adopted by them, was to avoid any recurrence to existing styles and to make the experiment of designing everything in accordance with the structural purpose or nature of the materials employedâ€”iron and cement. The office buildings are 580 feet long, varying from thirty to forty in width. The departments for directing and managing the affairs of the Company are carried on in the upper portion of the building, and those in connection with the traffic to and from the station in the lower part.

The space occupied by the platforms and lines of railway under the curved roofing is 700 feet long, and 240 feet six inches wide, and contains four platforms and ten lines of railway The two platforms on the departure side of the station are respectively twenty-seven feet and twenty-four feet six inches wide; and the other two, on the arrival side, are twenty-one feet and forty-seven inches. The latter is of stone. The rooting over the above space is divided into three longitudinal openings, with two transepts, each fifty feet wide, at one-third and two-thirds of the length, the length of which are each 700 feet, and their respective widths seventy feet, 102 feet six inches, and sixty-eight feet. The central half of the curved roofs is glazed, and the other portion is covered with corrugated galvanized iron. The work
was done by Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co.

On the departure of the train, it threads the sinuosities of the station at an easy rate, and we have time to notice the metamorphosis that has taken place in the em-irons of the line; walls have become green embankments, embankments diminished into hedges, and bodges grown into avenues of trees, waving a leafy adieu as we are carried past, The increasing velocity of the train now conveys us rapidly into the suburbs of the metropolis--past Kensal Green Cemetery on the right, Wormwood Scrubs on the left, and a transient glimpse is obtained of the London and North-Western Railway winding its course towards the midland counties.

The route at first lies through the Thames Valley, then, after passing the. elevated plains to the north of Marborough Downs, it gradually descends down into the fertile and picturesque valley of the Avon. Emerging from a slight excavation, we came to an embankment crossing Old Oak Common so named from its having been the site of a thick forest of oaks. The village of Acton, which lies to the left is linked to the metropolis by one almost uninterrupted line of houses, through which the North-Western Junction Railway passes, connecting the North-Western Railway with those of the South-Western.

## Slough to Maidenhead
Between the lofty and luxuriant foliage of Stoke Park, about two miles to the right of Slough, may be descried, modestly peering through the surrounding trees, the spire of Stoke Pogis Church, the scene of Gray's "Elegy." The following inscription to his memory is on the east wall of the church:--"Opposite to this stone, in the same tomb upon which he has so feelingly recorded his grief at the loss of a beloved parent, lie deposited the remains of Thomas Gray, the author of the 'Elegy written in a Country Churchyard,' &c, &c, &c. He was buried August 6th, 1771." The church itself has no internal beauty, being over-crowded with pews; but the churchyard is one of the prettiest in England. The cloister is worth a visit. As the train proceeds, the broad and verdant fields spread out on each side of us in all the pride of luxuriant vegetation.

Burnham Village is close by, situate in the midst of picturesque woodland scenery, popularised by the adventures of Albert Smith's Mr. Ledbury.
