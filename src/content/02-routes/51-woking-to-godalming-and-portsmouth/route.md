text: This route is a continuation of the line via [Guildford](/stations/guildford) and [Godalming](/stations/godalming) to [Portsmouth](/stations/portsmouth), bringing the latter place about 21 miles nearer London than by the old route, via Bishopstoke.

At [Petersfield](/stations/petersfield) a line to the left about 9 miles long runs though [Rogate](/stations/rogate) and [Elstead](/stations/elsted) to [Midhurst](/stations/midhurst). It is intended, ultimately, to carry the line forward to [Petworth](/stations/petworth), in connection with the Brighton system. The distance, at present, is traversed by coach.
