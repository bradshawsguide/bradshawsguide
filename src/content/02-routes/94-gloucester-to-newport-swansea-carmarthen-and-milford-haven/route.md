text: ## Gloucester to Newport

This line of railway affords great facilities to tourists and lovers of the picturesque for visiting the beautiful scenery of Wales.

Gloucester is now the central point of communication between the north and the south, the east and the west of the kingdom. From Plymouth there is an uninterrupted run through Bristol and Gloucester into the farthest points of the north where the iron road has yet pierced its way.

Upon starting, the line proceeds over an embankment and viaduct over the low meadows near the Severn, and then passes over the two bridges, and continues along the west bank of the Severn. The beautiful spire of Higham new church appears in view, and is quickly left behind, and in a few minutes the train reaches the first station on the line, which is called "[Oakle Street](/stations/oakle-street)," a rural spot, convenient for Churcham.

[Grange Court Junction](/stations/grange-court-junction).--Westbury-upon-Severn, 1 mile distant. The trains of the [Hereford, Ross, and Gloucester Railway](/routes/gloucester-to-ross-and-hereford) turn off at this station to the right.

## Grange Court to Newport
The forest hills are soon approached, and then we obtain a glimpse of the Severn, and passing on through Broadoak, we reach the station at [Newnham](/stations/newnham).

Immediately after leaving this station a short tunnel passes underneath the East Dean Road, and, emerging thence, a fine reach of the Severn, called Bullo Pill, is presented to view.

The line passes along the margin of the river for several miles, and in some places the water is so near, that at high tides it approaches close to the railway.

At [Woolaston](/stations/woolaston) we leave the county of Gloucester, and enter that of Monmouth.

## Newport to Cardiff
From [Newport](/stations/newport), we pass through a short tunnel and cross the river Ebbw, soon after arriving at [Marshfield](/stations/marshfield) Station, situated in a dreary extent of country, called the Westloeg Level. Crossing the river Rumney, we enter Glamorganshire.
