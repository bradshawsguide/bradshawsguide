text: This company has now two termini in London; both conveniently situated to accommodate pleasure and business traffic. The West End terminus is a portion of the extensive Victoria station, Pimlico, whilst the City station is at Farringdon Street, where it unites with the Metropolitan or under-ground railway to King's Cross and Paddington. This section of the line, under the name of the [Metropolitan Extension](victoria-to-herne-hill), joins with that of the Western at Herne Hill, and has become very much crowded with local traffic. Leaving Victoria, we almost immediately cross the Thames, pass [Battersea Park](/stations/battersea-park-road), and arrive at [Stewart's Lane](/stations/stewarts-lane), at which are situate extensive works belonging to the company. From thence we pass [Wandsworth Road](/stations/wandsworth-road), [Clapham](/stations/clapham), and [Brixton](/stations/brixton) to [Herne Hill](/stations/herne-hill), the point of connection with the City or eastern section of the line. On leaving [Farringdon Street](/stations/farringdon-street) the line is carried across [Ludgate Hill](/stations/ludgate-hill) by means of a highly ornamented viaduct, and from thence over the Alexandra Bridge, a truly magnificent specimen of engineering skill, to [Blackfriars](/stations/blackfriars). The Charing Cross railway attracts our attention for a moment, when, on passing the station at [Borough Road](/stations/borough-road), we arrive at the well-known station of the

[Elephant and Castle](/stations/elephant-and-castle), from whence omnibuses may be had to almost every part of the metropolis.

[Wallworth Road](/stations/wallworth-road), [Camberwell Road](/stations/camberwell-road), and [Loughborough Road](/stations/loughborough-road) stations.

[Brixton](/stations/brixton). -- The [line used for the Crystal Palace](/stations/crystal-palace) traffic takes rather a circuitous course eastward from this station, passing [Denmark Hill](/stations/denmark-hill), [Peckham Rye](/stations/peckham-rye), [Honor Oak](/stations/honor-oak), and [Lordship Lane](/stations/lordship-lane), to the [Crystal Palace](/stations/crystal-palace).

On leaving Loughborough Road on our route from the city, we next come to

[Herne Hill](/stations/herne-hill), from whence we proceed over a viaduct of 30 arches, 1,000 feet in extent, and which has from a distance a very picturesque appearance, Beyond this is an embankment of a mile and a quarter, in the middle of which is Dulwich station. Following the embankment is a cutting of one third of a mile in extent, with slopes of 4 to 1, This brings us when at the depth of 60 feet, to the tunnel under Sydenham hill, and at the face of which there is now erected a station for the accommodation of the neighbourhood. Immediately beyond the tunnel, the line passes under nine lines of railway belonging to the South Eastern and Brighton Companies. We next come to a small cutting which brings us to

[Penge](/stations/penge), and an embankment, similar in character to the one already mentioned, brings us to [Beckenham](/stations/beckenham). We next pass the station of [Shortlands](/stations/shortlands), and at the distance of three quarters of a mile further, arrive at [Bromley](/stations/bromley).
