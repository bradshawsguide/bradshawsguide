text: Presuming that our traveller is intended for Epsom, we proceed by the line of rails past [Croydon](/stations/croydon) town station, and pass by the pretty little village of *Beddington*, and the time-honoured seat of the Carews, thence to the station at [Carshalton](/stations/carshalton). Proceeding thense, we come to

[Sutton](/stations/sutton), 1½ mile from which is the Oaks, giving its name to the race, the seat of the Earl of Derby.

A short line of railway runs hence by [California](/stations/california), across *Banstead Downs*, a range of hills commanding some very pretty and extensive scenery, at the foot of which is the station of [Banstead](/stations/banstead). It extends to [Epsom Downs](/stations/epsom-downs), in the immediate neighbourhood of the Race Course.
