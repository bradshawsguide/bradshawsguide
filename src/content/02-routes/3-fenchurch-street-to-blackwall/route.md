text: The growing importance of the London and Blackwall Railway, the immense number of passengers passing through its London terminus, the increase anticipated from the working arrangements of the company with the Great Eastern and the Tilbury and Southend Railways, rendered an enlargement of the Fenchurch Street station necessary in 1853. The new terminus is a fine-looking building, and comprises booking offices and waiting rooms, from which you ascend by a flight of stairs on each side to the platform accommodation above for the following lines:-- London and Blackwall, the North London, the Great Eastern, and the Tilbury and Southend. These platforms are all covered with one roof, 100 feet span, and upwards of 300 feet long. The approach to the north side of the line has been much widened to admit of another line of carriages, as the traffic has so much increased, and the amount of goods conveyed to and from the eastern and western parts of the Metropolis for transmission on the various other lines of railway has become very great.

The line originally proceeded for a considerable distance under a covered way, lit by sash windows. This was considered necessary at the time of the construction of the Blackwall Railway, to prevent accidents by horses taking fright from the noise and smoke of the engines, as they dart over the bridges crossing the streets of London. The first bridge crossing the Minories is a specimen of these enclosed viaducts. Through the windows we have a glimpse of the Tower of London; but soon emerge from the covered, way amid roofs of houses and chimnies. We then pass the sugar-baking establishments of Goodman's Fields, which was a dairy farm in olden times. At the old theatre, now burnt down, Garrick the tragedian and Braham the singer made their *deb√ªt*. The London Docks, Wapping (what Englishman can forget, the inimitable Incledon's "Wapping Old Stairs?") St. George's-in-the-East, a neighbourhood densely crowded with a busy, clingy, working, or sea-going population. On the left we pass *Shadwell Church*, and also *St. Mary's Church* and *Schools*. We then continue our course nearly parallel to the Commercial Road, crossing by a stone bridge the north side of the Regent's Canal Dock, the terminus of the Regent's Canal. We next arrive at Stepney Station, and begin to breathe more freely, after having left behind the regions of smoke and gigantic chimneys.
