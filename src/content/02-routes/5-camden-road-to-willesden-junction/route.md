After passing [Kentish Town](/stations/kentish-town) we come to [Hampstead Heath](/stations/hampstead-heath). Soon after passing the station of [Finchley](/stations/finchley) we arrive at that of [Edgware Road](/stations/edgware-road), to the right of which Paddington Cemetery and the Victoria Rifles' Drill Ground are close at hand. [Kensal Green](/stations/kensal-green), a little to the left of the line, is next passed, and about a mile further we cross the main line of the [London and North Western](/companies/london-and-south-western), and thus pass on to the lines of the [North & South Western Junction](/companies/north-and-south-western-junction).
