text: Three miles to the left of which is Runcorn, where markets are held on Fridays. It has a population of 10,434, employed in the salt and coal trade. *Weston Point*, under the cliffs, lies about a mile lower down the river, at the confluence of the Weaver, and Runcorn Gap on the opposite side of the Mersey. *Halton Castle* commands fine views; it was built by Fitz Nigel, and a little beyond is *Aston Hall*, the seat of Sir A. Aston, for many years Ambassador at the Court of Spain. The canal suddenly falls here by ten locks.
