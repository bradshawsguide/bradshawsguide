text: On both sides of the line Woking Common is seen to extend for miles, only broken by the windings of the Basingstoke Canal, and terminated by a long range of woodland scenery, which stands out in picturesque relief against the horizon.

Three‐​quar­ters of a mile beyond Woking [a line branches off to the left](/routes/woking-to-godalming-and-portsmouth) to Guild­ford and Godalm­ing, direct to Ports­mouth, from which another branch diverges at Guild­ford and extends to Ash, Farnham, and Alton.
