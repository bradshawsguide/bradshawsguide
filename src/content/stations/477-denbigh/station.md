text: The situation of this town from a distance is very imposing, lying as it does on the side of a rocky eminence, the top of which is crowned with the ruins of a castle founded in the reign of Edward I. It was blown up with gunpowder after the restoration of Charles II. The prospect from its ruins is of a magnificent character.
