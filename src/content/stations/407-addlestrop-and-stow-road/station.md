text: *Daylesford House*, the seat of the celebrated Warren Hastings, and *Addlestrop House*, of the Leigh family, are close by. Stow-on-the-Wold, is a small market town on the summit of a hill, 883 feet high. The church, with its embattled tower 81 feet high, is consequently a prominent object through a circumference of many miles. It has many points and some curious monuments deserving attention.

Again proceeding on our way, we soon arrive at [Moreton-in-the-Marsh](/stations/moreton-in-the-marsh).
