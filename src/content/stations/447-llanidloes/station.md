text:  Situated at the confluence of the rivers Clywedog and Severn, returns one member to parliament, and. has a population of 3,127, principally engaged in the manufacture of woollen and coarse flannels. The church contains some interesting remains.

From this we may visit the source of the Rheidol, and *Blaen Hafran*, the source of the Severn on the edge of Plinlimmon. The road hence to *Machynlleth* is full of grand scenery (a distance of 18 miles), and we may add, the wildest road in the kingdom.

On the completion of the lines of railway from Llanidloes to Llandovery and the south, the whole of central Wales, abounding in rugged defiles, in secluded glens, darksome rivers (but full of fish), the sources of the Severn and the Wye, and many a relic of our stalwart ancestors, will be opened up to the tourist.
