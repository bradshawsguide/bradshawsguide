text: To the left, on the hills, is Wakehurst Place, the estate of Sir A. Cockburn, St. Leonard's Forest on the right. The rivers Adur, Arun, and Ouse have their source in this forest, within a circle of three or four miles in diameter.

A short distance further on the line crosses the Ouse by the viaduct of that name, one of the fittest works in the kingdom, which is only excelled by the viaduct over the Dee on the Chester and Shrewsbury Railway. It consists of 37 arches, and its summit commands extensive views of the surrounding country.

As we are whirled along it, the prospect presents us with an unbounded scene of beauty, the country round being steeped in the most luxuriant verdure, and hill and dale, woodland and pasture land, succeed each other in infinite variety to the very verge of the horizon.
