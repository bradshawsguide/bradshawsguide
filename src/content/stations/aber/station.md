text: Celebrated as being the last place where Llewellyn contended against Edward I., is a most delightful spot; having on the right the view of the Irish Channel, in front, Beaumaris and its wooded environs, and to the left the turrets of *Penrhyn Castle*. From this village, a deep and romantic glen, nearly 3 miles in length, forms the avenue to *Rhaiadr Mawr*, a celebrated cataract. The prospects in the neighbourhood afford views of most picturesque beauty, comprising the Snowdon mountains on the one hand, the Menai straits and the coast of Anglesea on the other, all together forming a rich panoramic view of splendid scenery.
