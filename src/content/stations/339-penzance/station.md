text: This flourishing port is at the farther end of Cornwall, on the west side of Mount's Bay, at the terminus of the West Cornwall Railway. It is a municipal, but not a parliamentary borough, with a population of 9,414. Tin, copper, china, clay, granite, and pilchards, are the principal articles of trade here.

The harbour, enclosed by a pier, 600 feet long, is shallow, but it is easy to reach and get out of. All the best shops are in the Market Place, where the four principal streets centre. The stannary court for the hundred of Penwith is abolished. An excellent Geological Society was founded in 1813; and is enriched by a full collection of specimens obtained by Dr. Boase, from every corner of the county, and carefully arranged. The churches and houses are of stone. Madron is the mother church. Sir Humphrey Davy, the great chemist, was born at Penzance, 1778; Penzance is a cheap and healthy place for a resident. The soil in the neighbourhood is light and rich, from the granite dust at the bottom, and produces uncommonly heavy crops of *potatoes*, the returns being 300 to 600 bushels an acre. Sand, shells, and pilchards, are used to manure it

The peninsula to the west of Penzance is particularly rich in both natural and artificial curiosities. It differs somewhat in its geological character from that part of the county we have hitherto traversed, and is much the richest in its mineral productions.

We will now follow the shore of Mount's Bay past the *Wherry Mine* and *Tol-Carne* (a pile of granite rocks) to *Newlyn* and *Mansehole* which has some quaint old buildings. The next object of beauty is the *Lamorna Cove*, from which we can visit *Boscawen Carn*, a singular pile of rocks. We may here leave the shore, and visit the very old church of *St. Buryan* with its singular cross, near which are the remains of some ancient ecclesiastical buildings. One mile to the north is a Druidical circle of 19 stones, and a central one called *Boseawen Un*. Returning to the coast we pass another circle called the "*Merry Maidens*" and two upright stones. "The Pipers;" at *Boskenna*, a cromlech. This leads us to *Penberth Cove*: thence we descend a steep hill, *Trereen Castle*, a fortified rocky promontory. Here amidst the bold and romantic is the celebrated *Logan Stone*, weighing 90 tons, though moved with a touch. One day in 1824 it was overturned by Lieut. Goldsmith and his crew, in consequence of a bet; but the people round were so highly indignant that he was compelled to replace it, which he did in a very ingenious manner, having, at the instance of Davies Gilbert, Esq., the President of the Royal Society, obtained help from the Plymouth Dockyard.

From this, passing by another pretty Cove called *Porthcurno*, *St. Levan*, and *Tol-Pedn-Penwith*, we catch sight of the bold promonteries of Cam Barra and *Pardennick Point*, and shortly after arrive at

The *Land's End*, the ancient *Antivestaeum*, the most westerly parish in England--being, in fact, nearly in a line with Dublin and the Western Islands of Scotland. On one side of the village sign-post is inscribed, "The first Inn in England" (if you come from the west), and the other, "The last Inn in England." Sweetbriar grows here wild. Sennen Cove is a little creek in Whitsand Bay. Longships Reefs, half a mile long, has a lighthouse on it, 83 feet high. The effects of the Atlantic and the weather upon the hardest rocks (as granite is supposed to be) are visible all along this broken and disintegrated coast--a wild desolate region to the eye, but extremely healthful and inspiriting. Rare shells, sea weeds, and plants, should be looked for.

Some miles out are the Seven Stones light vessels. About 25 miles south-west are the *Scilly Islands*, a group of 50 or 60 granite islands and reefs, with an industrious population of 2,594. They belong to the Godolphin family. St. Mary's is the largest. Here Sir Cloudesley Shovel, and four ships with 2,000 men were wrecked in a dreadful storm in 1707. A lighthouse has been fixed on St. Agnes since this fearful event.

Proceeding northward by *Whitesand Bay*, we pass *Carnbrea Castle*, a small remain on a ledge of rocks, with a camp near it, to

**St. Just,** where there are the remains of a cross, an amphitheatre, with stone seats, and a logan stone. Close by is *Cape Cornwall*, with a splendid sea view. Here are the Levant and Botallic mines, both prosperous concerns, and finding tin and copper. *Botallick Mine* is worked in the very face of the cliffs, and runs out 100 fathoms under the sea. It was descended by the Due de Nemours, Prince de Joinville, and their party, in 1852 and by the Prince and Princess of Wales in August, 1865. The Mayne or Maen stone is pointed out as that on which the Saxon King, Ethelbert, and six other kings, dined, in the year 600. Several stone circles intersecting each other may be seen here.

Our route now lies by the *Lanyon Guoit*, a fine cromlech, to *Pendeen*, near which is Chun Castle, an oval inclosure, with vallum and ditches, and a Cromlech near it. Here we may visit the gravestone of Riolobran, and the holed stone, from which we round *Gurnard's Head* (at *Zennor* another cromlech), whence we may return to Penzance by *Madron* (with the remains of a holy well), and *Trengwainton Cairn*, being a tour of a few days, unequalled in England.

Before leaving Penzance, however, we would recommend a visit to *Gulval Church* and Cross, and a fine Cairn, *Castlean-Dinas*, an old fortification of three circles, and *Ludgvan Church*, where Borlase, the historian, lived and died--a short morning excursion.

### Coast Route from Penzance to Bude.
In returning the traveller will do well to follow the north coast of the comity to *Bude*, a route affording more enjoyment than the one through the centre to *Launceston*, but certainly one of more difficulty. Reaching *St. Agnes*, from the Redruth station, we find a peculiar-looking hill, 621 feet high, called *St. Agnes Beacon* (Opie, the painter, was a native), proceeding past which, by way of the sands and *Cliggor Head*, we come to Piran Sands, or *Perranzabuloe*, where may be seen an amphitheatre, and the remains of an old church of St. Piran, an ancient British edifice, which had been covered by the shifting sands for many centuries. The discovery gave rise to Mr. Trelawney's work, the "Lost Church Found," in which he shows what the primitive English church was before corrupted by Popery. This and other parishes were named from the famous St. Piran, the patron of tinners.

We can now proceed to *St. Columb Major*, which has a spacious early cross, church, and some ancient buildings, In the vicinity is *Rialton Priory*, founded by Pinor Vivian, a picturesque ruin. To the south is a fine earthwork, in a lofty situation, called King Arthur's Castle, or *Castle-an-Dinas*. Thence by *Mawgan* in the beautiful vale of Lanherne, where there is a fine old church, with some monuments and brasses, and a beautiful church-yard cross, *Lanherne Nunnery*, still inhabited by its recluses, in the neighbourhood--a most beautiful part of the coast this from Mawgan Point, by *Trevose Head*, to Padstow. *Prideaux Castle*, or Place House, a fine Tudor building, close by. Crossing the ferry here we may see more churches half buried in sand.

We may now proceed to *Camelford*, a very ancient town, near which are the celebrated slate quarries of Delabole, belonging to the Trevanion family. Four miles north is *Bossiney* and the old castle of *Tintagel*, situated on a stupendous crag, washed by the ever-fretful waves of the Atlantic. As the palace and home of the renowned Arthur, we cannot but look on the deserted wails with a degree of enthusiasm. *Cadon Barrow*, near, is 1,011 feet high. A wild and picturesque road leads to *Boscastle*, or Bottreaux Castle, with the remains of its old castle, and some ecclesiastical buildings. From this place we pass *St. Gennis* and *Poundstock* to

**Bude**--a small port and picturesque village in the north-eastern extremity of Cornwall--has, within the last half-dozen years, risen to the dignity of a fashionable marine resort, to which distinction the excellent facilities it affords to bathers, and the picturesque scenery of its environs, have in a great measure contributed. The bed of the harbour, which is dry at low water, is composed of a fine bright yellow sand, chiefly consisting of small shells. The sea view is of a striking, bold, and sublime description--the rocks rising on every side to lofty broken elevations; and those who desire a sequestered and romantic retreat will find in Bude the very object of their wish. The Bude Canal was commenced in 1819, and completed in 1826, at a cost of Â£128,000. It terminates within three miles of Launceston, forming an internal communication through Devon and Cornwall of nearly forty miles. Bude is fifty-two miles from Exeter.

At *Stratton*, two miles further, a severe battle was fought between the Earl of Stamford and the parliamentarians, and the royalists, under Sir Ralph Hopton. The remains of the ancient castle of Bimomy and *Kilhampton* Norman church are at hand.

Instead of proceeding to Bude as above, the traveller may, if he choose, when at Wadebridge, continue his course through Bodmin to Launceston, but the route has not much interest until the high tors, *Rough Tor* and *Brown Willy*, rise above the desolate and lonely moors around. From the village of *Temple* a stout walker may visit many interesting localities and romantic scenes, the huge peaks here rising to 1,000 and 1,300 feet high; or he may turn to the right and see *Dozmeri Pool*, the *Cheesewring*, and the *Hurlers*, regaining the road by the Fowey river. Which way, however, he may take, he will find new beauties and new scenes to interest and astonish him, but which the space at our disposal will not allow us to enter upon.
