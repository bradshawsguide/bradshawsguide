text: This station is situated in the centre of the town, which is a sea port and market town, with a population of 3,428, who return one member, as well as the county itself. There are extensive collieries, the coals from which are shipped from here to Liverpool, Ireland, and various parts of Wales. The ruins of *Flint Castle* are seen on the right, at no very great distance from the railway, situated on a rock which juts out towards the sea. It is a memento of other ages, and is peculiarly rich in historical associations, one of the most celebrated events connected with it being the deposition of Richard II. The castle is but a mere shell there being left only the grey ruined walls, and the two outside concentric walls with the gallery, to attest its former strength and grandeur.
