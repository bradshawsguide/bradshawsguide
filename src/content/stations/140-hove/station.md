text: This village is now a suburb, or continuation of Brighton. The old church of Hove is a fine edifice, and there is a new cross-shaped one, with a tall spire. There are fine walks here over the Downs. The summit of a high cliff in the neighbourhood, called the Devil's Dyke, is much visited for the fine views it affords of the surrounding country.
