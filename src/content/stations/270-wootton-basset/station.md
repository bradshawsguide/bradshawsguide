text: We now proceed on an embankment, having a rapid descent in our favour of about fifty feet in a mile. This elevation affords a comprehensive view of the adjoining valley of "Bath's clear Avon," through which the companionable canal is still seen gleaming amid the line of pollards that fringe its edge. Passing through a short, excavation we again emerge on a level, whence to the left can be discerned, afar off, the stately structure of Bradenstoke Priory. Thence by alternate cutting and embankment we reach [Chippenham](/stations/chippenham).
