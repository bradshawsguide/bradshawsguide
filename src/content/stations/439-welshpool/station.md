text: A place of considerable trade, in flannels, and in malt. Population, 5,004. The Severn here becomes navigable. About 1 mile from the town is *Powis Castle*, the ancient seat of the Clive family, occupying a commanding situation; it overlooks a vast tract of country, and is a large and magnificent seat.

Eight miles north-west is *Llanfawr*. On the hill above is the site of the old Roman station *Castell Caer Einion*. The River *Vyrnwy*, here is a good angling stream, indeed the whole of the streams, and the Linns (of which there are several) abound with fish, and on every hill there are the remains of camps or entrenchments.
