text: This station is looked upon as the prettiest on this line. The village of Whittington is in a picturesque situation, and so situated that the roads from Shrewsbury to Llangollen, and from Ellesmere to Oswestry pass through it. About half a mile from the station are the ruins of Whittington Castle, which are strikingly picturesque and beautiful; and having been the birth-place and residence of Fulk Fitz-Gwarin, one of the barons who extorted from King John the Magna Charta, as well as the scene of his surprising adventures, and belonging to the Peverells, it is regarded with much interest by all visitors.

In the vicinity are (1 mile) *Halston*, the ancient house of the Myttons, in which the famous General of that name was born.
