text: It is a small manufacturing town, situated on the slope of a hill, with a considerable miscellaneous trade.

Ten miles up the coast is *Harlech*, with its historical old ruined castle, from which *Craig Ddrwg* and the *Rhinog Faur* (upwards of 2,000 feet high) may be climbed, with every yard full of Druidical and British remains.

From hence to Dolgelley the road runs along the northern bank of the river, commanding good views of the majestic *Cader Idris*, with its Cyclopean precipices, about 2Â½ miles to the right. On arriving at the village of *Llanelltyd* we take the road to the south to the town of Dolgelley; or, if the tourist prefer, he may recross Barmouth Ferry and proceed by rail to [Penmaen Pool](/stations/penman-pool), and thence by omnibus to [Dolgelley](/stations/dolgelley).
