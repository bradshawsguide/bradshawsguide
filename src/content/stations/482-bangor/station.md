text: A cathedral town and bathing place in Carnarvonshire, North Wales, near Snowdon, and only 2¼ miles from the Britannia Bridge. You enter it by a tunnel 3,000 feet long. It is an excellent resting place, not only for the fine mountain scenery of this quarter, but for the *Britannia* and *Menai Bridges*, the *Penrhyn Slate Quarries*, *Beaumaris Castle*, and other exclusions, by road, railway, and boat. More than 50,000 persons come here in the season, so that lodgings at such times are high and difficult to be had. About 40 years ago there were only 90 houses, now there arc 1,331, to a population of 6,738.

The "city" is chiefly a long street, winding about under the rocks towards *Garth Point*, where there is the public promenade, besides a ferry over the Lavan Sands to Beaumaris, on the Anglesea side. The peaks round Snowdon, and the rocky headlands of Penmaen Mawr and Orme's Head are in view.

Among the buildings are the *Assembly Rooms*, *Shone's Library*, *County Dispensary*, *Glynne's Grammar School*, and a small plain *Cathedral*, 23 feet long, with a low tower, not older than the 10th century--the former one having been burnt by Owen Gwyndwr or Glendower. It was originally founded by St. Deiniol as early as 000, whence Bangor claims to be the oldest diocese in Wales. The income is £4,000 per annum. This argument was used when there was a talk of suppressing it some years back. There are tombs of two Welsh princes, Gryfydd (or Griffith) ap Cynan and Owen Gwyndwr; and a new painted window placed here by Dean Cotton, through whose exertions the church has been restored. It is the parish church to the town, the service being in Welsh. In the library is the missal and anthem book of Bishop Anian, who held the see in Edward I.'s time. Another bishop was Hoadley, appointed by George I.; he preached a sermon here from the text, <q>My kingdom is not of this world,</q> so displeasing to the high church party, that it gave rise to a long dispute--the celebrated Bangorian Controversy.
