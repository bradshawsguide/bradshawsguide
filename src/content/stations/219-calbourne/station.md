text: Calbourne has an old church and is near to Westover Park. To the right, about two miles, is Shalfleet church, which contains a Norman porch, and the escutcheon of William de Montacute, to whom Wight was granted by Richard II.

The road skirts the north base of the Downs, with a prospect over the partly cultivated tract to the north, the Solent, and Hampshire. At length we reach Freshwater Village, at the head of Yarmouth Creek, Freshwater Gate being to the left. Dr. Hook the philosopher was born at the parsonage.

At the entrance of this creek is [Yarmouth](/stations/yarmouth).
