text: About two miles from this station is the rotten borough of Grampound, one of the many existing in Cornwall (which, being a crown duchy, the court influence was the paramount), but disfranchised for gross corruption, in 1841.

From Grampound, *Trewithian* and its beautiful grounds are passed, and *Probus*, with its elaborately decorated church tower; *Tregothnan*, the seat of the Earl of Falmouth, and *Pencalenich*, that of T. Vivian. Esq., and Ave see before us from the top of a high hill the picturesquely-situated town of [Truro](/stations/truro).
