text: 4 miles south is the old town of *Burford*, full of quaint houses, with paneled gables and tracery work. The church is cruciform, with several large chapels attached, all partaking of the Norman or early perpendicular character. A battle took place here in 752 between the rival Kings of Wessex and Mercia. Three miles on the Northleach road is Lord Dynevor's elegant mansion at *Barrington*.

Three miles beyond Shipton we arrive at the junction of the Chipping Norton Branch, and at a distance of four miles further, at the ancient town of [Chipping Norton](/stations/chipping-norton).
