text: An old Market town situated on the rise of a hill. There is a Free Grammar School, and a venerable church with an embattled tower, and an ancient rood loft. In the vicinity are *Knollbury banks*, an old encampment, and there is the site of an old castle, beyond is *Cornewell* (2Â½ miles),--Pennystones, Esq.; *Heythorpe* (2 miles); and *Great Tew Park* (4 miles); and an interesting Druidical remain called the *Rollrich stones* (3 miles).

Another branch line turns off to the left from this junction to [Bourton-on-the-Water](/stations/bourton-on-the-water), a small village on the side of a Roman Foss-way, leading from Cirencester to Stow-on-the-Wold.

Returning to the junction of the Main line, we pursue our journey onwards to [Addlestrop and Stow Road](/stations/addlestrop-and-stow-road).
